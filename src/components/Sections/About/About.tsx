          I build pixel-perfect front end experiences and love finding things to
          reverse-engineer to tease my brain. When I'm not coding you can find
          me by the ocean with fishing rod in hand, or exploring Hyrule mainly
          for its puzzles. The princess can wait.

            {`Before I made the switch into software engineering I was a wearer of many hats--salesman, data analyst, community manager, and a few more. With each role, there was always one connecting thread: leveraging technology to solve those problems programmatically.
